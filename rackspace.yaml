  #### Getting Started
  If you are new to Umbraco, the [Umbraco
  Community](http://our.umbraco.org/forum) has great ressources to
  get you started. The documentation is available [here](http://our.umbraco.org/documentation).
  Umbraco provides [Training and Support](http://umbraco.com/help-and-support.aspx) and their
  [Video Library](http://umbraco.com/help-and-support/video-tutorials/getting-started/what-is-umbraco) is very informative.

  #### Logging into Umbraco
  To login, use the IP address of the server or point an A record to your
  server's IP. The domain you provided has also been used to set the [host
  file](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-do-i-modify-my-hosts-file)
  on the server. Therefore you can open a RDP session to the server,
  open the domain in the web browser and pursue the last step of the Umbraco
  site activation.

  #### Additional Licensing
  Umbraco is open source under the [MIT
  Licence](http://umbraco.com/products/license).

  #### Logging in via Remote Desktop
  The Administrator password is included in the passwords/secrets section
  of this deployment. Use that password and the instructions found
  [here](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-to-your-server-via-rdp-windows)
  to login and begin managing Umbraco.

  #### Uploading Files via FTP
  The FTP password is included in the passwords/secrets section
  of this deployment. You may use [Filezilla FTP Client](https://filezilla-project.org/)
  or [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.io/) with the FTP credential to upload your application.

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This setup was built through a [Powershell
  Script](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/dd742419.aspx).
  Once the deployment is up, the script will not be run again, so it is
  safe to change settings and configurations on your server and within
  Umbraco.

  #### Post Installation Permissions check
  After the deployment, please verify Umbraco permissions check by opening
  following the instruction on the following wiki
  [article](http://our.umbraco.org/wiki/reference/files-and-folders/permissions/perform-permissions-check).
